## Overview

This code is tested with the [Harbor Freight 6.5hp 212cc OHC Horizontal Shaft Gas Engine EPA&CARB](https://www.harborfreight.com/engines-generators/gasoline-engines/65-hp-212cc-ohv-horizontal-shaft-gas-engine-epacarb-69727.html)

Okay, so this is a super early stage of this project, but as of this post, it does work in the 
configuration uploaded.

If you want to do nothing else becides make the test engine run, edit the two degree functions as 
noted in the comments. One is intake, one is exhaust. It will require some
tweaking to perfectly work. My values were around 252 degrees Open and 102 Close (next cycle) For 
exhaust, and then 30 degrees open and 252 Closed for intake. I will update as I get a better 
understanding of the abilities- there's a few odd things with this cam that I'm still working through.

12/14/20 EDIT: Thank you to everyone who sent feedback and some updates, I appriciate it. I'll update 
some of the improved code soon, hopefully later this week. Thanks!
The Cam Mapping tool is a recent addition, but I think it's pretty solid. For use with the cam tool.
