This is the two pieces of software I used to run the Cam mapping tool. 
Run the calibration to map your potentiometers, and then run the main program to record.

I know it's absolutely possible to export directly to excel, but I wanted to keep this a bit 
more open in case some people don't have excel. In that sense it's completely cross-compatible 
across operating systems.
